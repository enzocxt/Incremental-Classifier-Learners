This is the archive for BIG DATA ANALYTICS PROGRAMMING, assignment 2. 

In this archive you will find the following files:

- code/LogisticRegression.java: a class stub (to be completed) for the logistic regression classifier algorithm. 
- code/Vfdt.java: a class stub (to be completed) for the VFDT classifier algorithm. 
- code/VfdtNode.java: a class stub (to be completed) to make a VFDT tree node for the VFDT algorithm. 
- code/Makefile: a makefile to compile and run and test your implementation. See make testnb and make testvftd. 
- code/Data.java: a java helper class to load datasets.

- data/zoo-train.dat: a simple (small) training set.
- data/zoo-test.dat: a simple (small) testing set. 
- data/zoo-feature-description.dat: a brief description for each feature in the zoo dataset.
